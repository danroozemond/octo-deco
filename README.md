This tool comes with all the usual warnings, and all of the usual "no guarantee"s. I've found it fun to write, I've found it's a useful tool to help me understand decompression theory, and I would use it as a tool to plan decompression dives. I would always check decompression profiles against tables or another tool.

TL;DR:

# Features
* Decompression computations using BÃ¼hlmann ZHL-16C with Gradient Factors,
  directly usable as a Python library 
* Tightly integrated with web app allowing creation, deletion and manipulation
  of dive profiles
* Insightful plots, not just of the dive itself, but also eg. heat maps of tissue loading
* Gas consumption computations, including lost-gas scenarios
* Import dives from Shearwater computers (through CSV) 
* Analysis of options for decompression profiles from gradient factors

TODO finish
  
A version of the library is available directly from [octo-deco.nl](https://octo-deco.nl).
